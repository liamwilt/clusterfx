# colourdi
*ColourDi* is a game designed to assess eye hand coordination capabilities. Users are directed to track and select circuluar targets of varying size and colour. Target motion is randomized and utilizes rudimentary 2-D physics. Program output details an array of data, including "time to target" (a timed navigation component) and "accuracy-of-selection" totals. It is one of several programs that when utilized together comprise the *ColourS* program package - a more extensive set of simple games designed to assess and train eye hand coordination skills. To learn more about the *ColourS* package, please refer to the [repository](https://github.com/liamwilt/colours) for details on how to download and use the program.
